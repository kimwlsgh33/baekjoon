The following script enhances
Ctrl-A and Ctrl-X so that they operate on the next number,
even if that number is not on the current line (they search for the next number).
Also, assuming the default backslash leader key,
typing \ then Ctrl-A or Ctrl-X will search backwards and operate on the previous number.
